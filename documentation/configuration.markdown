Puppet Server honors almost all settings in `puppet.conf` and should pick them
up automatically. However, for some tasks, such as configuring the webserver or an external Certificate Authority, we have introduced new Puppet Server-specific configuration files and settings. These new files and settings are detailed below.  For more information on the specific differences in Puppet Server's support for `puppet.conf` settings as compared to the Ruby master, see the [puppet.conf differences](./puppet_conf_setting_diffs.markdown) page.

## Config Files

All of Puppet Server's new config files and settings (with the exception of the [logging config file](#logging)) are located in the `conf.d` directory. These new config files are in HOCON format. HOCON keeps the basic structure of JSON, but is a more human-readable config file format. You can find details about this format in the [HOCON documentation](https://github.com/typesafehub/config/blob/master/HOCON.md).

At startup, Puppet Server reads all the `.conf` files found in this directory, located at `/etc/puppetlabs/puppetserver/conf.d`. Note that if you change these files and their settings, you must restart Puppet Server for those changes to take effect. The `conf.d` directory contains the following files and settings:

### `global.conf`

This file contains global configuration settings for Puppet Server. You shouldn't typically need to make changes to this file. However, you can change the `logging-config` path for the logback logging configuration file if necessary. For more information about the logback file, see [http://logback.qos.ch/manual/configuration.html](http://logback.qos.ch/manual/configuration.html).

~~~
global: {
  logging-config: /etc/puppetlabs/puppetserver/logback.xml
}
~~~

### `webserver.conf`

This file contains the web server configuration settings. The `webserver.conf` file looks something like this:

~~~
webserver: {
    client-auth = need
    ssl-host = 0.0.0.0
    ssl-port = 8140
}

# configure the mount points for the web apps
web-router-service: {
    # These two should not be modified because the Puppet 3.x agent expects them to
    # be mounted at "/"
    "puppetlabs.services.ca.certificate-authority-service/certificate-authority-service": ""
    "puppetlabs.services.master.master-service/master-service": ""

    # This controls the mount point for the puppet admin API.
    "puppetlabs.services.puppet-admin.puppet-admin-service/puppet-admin-service": "/puppet-admin-api"
}
~~~

The above settings set the webserver to require a valid certificate from the client; to listen on all available hostnames for encrypted HTTPS traffic; and to use port 8140 for encrypted HTTPS traffic. For full documentation, including a complete list of available settings and values, see
[Configuring the Webserver Service](https://github.com/puppetlabs/trapperkeeper-webserver-jetty9/blob/master/doc/jetty-config.md).

By default, Puppet Server is configured to use the correct Puppet Master and CA certificates. If you're using an external CA and have provided your own certificates and keys, make sure `webserver.conf` points to the correct file. For details about configuring an external CA, see the [External CA Configuration](./external_ca_configuration.markdown) page.

### `puppetserver.conf`

[configuration directory]: /puppet/latest/reference/dirs_confdir.html
[code directory]: /puppet/latest/reference/dirs_codedir.html
[cache directory]: /puppet/latest/reference/dirs_vardir.html

This file contains the settings for Puppet Server itself.

> **Note:** Most users should never set the `master-conf-dir` or `master-code-dir` settings to a non-default value. If you do, you must also change the equivalent Puppet settings (`confdir` or `codedir`) to ensure that commands like `puppet cert` and `puppet module` will use the same directories as Puppet Server. Note also that a non-default `confdir` must be specified on the command line when running commands, since that setting must be set before Puppet tries to find its config file.

* The `jruby-puppet` settings configure the interpreter:
    * `ruby-load-path`: Where the Puppet Server expects to find Puppet, Facter, etc.
    * `gem-home`: This setting determines where JRuby looks for gems. It is
      also used by the `puppetserver gem` command line tool. If not specified,
      uses the Puppet default `/opt/puppetlabs/server/data/puppetserver/jruby-gems`.
    * `master-conf-dir`: Optionally, set the path to the Puppet
      [configuration directory][]. If not specified, the default is `/etc/puppetlabs/puppet`.
    * `master-code-dir`: Optionally, set the path to the Puppet [code directory][].
      If not specified, the default is `/etc/puppetlabs/code`.
    * `master-var-dir`: Optionally, set the path to the Puppet [cache directory][].
      If not specified, the default is
      `/opt/puppetlabs/server/data/puppetserver`.
    * `master-run-dir`: Optionally, set the path to the run directory, where the service's PID file is stored.
      If not specified, the default is `/var/run/puppetlabs/puppetserver`.
    * `master-log-dir`: Optionally, set the path to the log directory.
      If not specified, uses the Puppet default `/var/log/puppetlabs/puppetserver`.
    * `max-active-instances`: Optionally, set the maximum number of JRuby
      instances to allow. Defaults to 'num-cpus - 1', with a minimum default
      value of 1 and a maximum default value of 4.
    * `max-requests-per-instance`: Optionally, limit how many HTTP requests a
      given JRuby instance will handle in its lifetime. When a JRuby instance
      reaches this limit, it gets flushed from memory and replaced with a fresh
      one. Defaults to 0, which disables automatic JRuby flushing.

        This can be useful for working around buggy module code that would
        otherwise cause memory leaks, but it causes a slight performance penalty
        whenever a new JRuby has to reload all of the Puppet Ruby code.  If memory
        leaks from module code are not an issue in your deployment, the default
        value will give the best performance.
    * `borrow-timeout`: Optionally, set the timeout when attempting to borrow
      an instance from the JRuby pool in milliseconds. Defaults to 1200000.
    * `use-legacy-auth-conf`: Optionally, set the method to be used for
      authorizing access to the HTTP endpoints served by the "master" service.
      The applicable endpoints include those listed in the
      [Puppet V3 HTTP API](https://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/4.2/reference/http_api/http_api_index.html#puppet-v3-http-api).
      For a value of `true`, also the default value if not specified,
      authorization will be done in core Ruby puppet-agent code via the legacy
      [`auth.conf`](https://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/4.2/reference/config_file_auth.html)
      file.  For a value of `false`, authorization will be done by
      `trapperkeeper-authorization` via rules specified in an `authorization`
      configuration.  See the [`auth.conf`](#authconf) section on this page for
      more information.  Note that the legacy `auth.conf` is now deprecated in
      Puppet Server, so it is recommended to use `trapperkeeper-authorization`
      instead.
* The `profiler` settings configure profiling:
    * `enabled`: if this is set to `true`, it enables profiling for the Puppet
    Ruby code. Defaults to `false`.
* The `puppet-admin` section configures the Puppet Server's administrative API.
  (This is a new API, which isn't provided by Rack or WEBrick Puppet masters.)
  With the introduction of `trapperkeeper-authorization` for authorizing
  requests made to Puppet Server, the settings in this section are now
  deprecated.  You should consider removing these settings and configuring
  the desired authorization behavior through `trapperkeeper-authorization`
  instead.  See the [`auth.conf`](#authconf) section for more details.
    * `authorization-required` determines whether a client
    certificate is required to access the endpoints in this API.  If set to
    `false`, all requests will be permitted to access this API.  If set to
    `true`, only the clients whose certnames are included in the
    `client-whitelist` setting are allowed access to the admin API.  If this
    setting is not specified but the `client-whitelist` setting is specified,
    the default value for this setting is `true`.
    * `client-whitelist` contains a list of client certnames that are whitelisted
    to access the admin API. Any requests made to this endpoint that do not
    present a valid client certificate mentioned in this list will be denied
    access.
    
   If neither the `authorization-required` nor the `client-whitelist` setting
   is specified, authorization to the admin API endpoints is controlled by
   `trapperkeeper-authorization`, through settings specified in the
   [`auth.conf`](#authconf) file.

### `auth.conf`

This file contains rules for authorizing access to the HTTP endpoints that
Puppet Server hosts.  The file looks something like this:

~~~
authorization: {
    version: 1
    rules: [
        {
            # Allow nodes to retrieve their own catalog
            match-request: {
                path: "^/puppet/v3/catalog/([^/]+)$"
                type: regex
                method: [get, post]
            }
            allow: "$1"
            sort-order: 500
            name: "puppetlabs catalog"
        },
...
~~~

Puppet Server uses `trapperkeeper-authorization` for authorization control.
For more detailed information on the format of this file, see
[Configuring the Authorization Service](https://github.com/puppetlabs/trapperkeeper-authorization/blob/master/doc/authorization-config.md).

If you need to customize the authorization rules for Puppet Server, it is
recommended that you create new rules rather than customizing the default
"puppetlabs" rules which appear in this file.  In order for your rules to
"override" any corresponding "puppetlabs" rules, you should use a
`sort-order` for those rules which is in the range of 1 to 399 (inclusive).
Note that default rules from Puppet occupy the range from 400 to 600 (inclusive).

For example, if you wanted to customize the behavior of the default "catalog"
rule from above to not only allow nodes to retrieve their own catalog but also
allow an "administrative" node to retrieve any node's catalog, you could add
a rule like this:

~~~
authorization: {
    version: 1
    # allow-header-cert-info: false
    rules: [
        {
            # Allow nodes to retrieve their own catalog
            # and admin nodes to retrieve any catalogs
            match-request: {
                path: "^/puppet/v3/catalog/([^/]+)$"
                type: regex
                method: [get, post]
            }
            allow: ["$1", "myadmin.host.com"]
            sort-order: 200
            name: "my catalog"
        },
        {
            # Allow nodes to retrieve their own catalog
            match-request: {
                path: "^/puppet/v3/catalog/([^/]+)$"
                type: regex
                method: [get, post]
            }
            allow: "$1"
            sort-order: 500
            name: "puppetlabs catalog"
        },
...
~~~

If you want to add a rule but let the default rules from Puppet take
precedence over your new rule, you should use a `sort-order` for the rule
which is in the range from 601 to 999 (inclusive).

Note that, for backward compatibility, the values of other configuration
settings control the specific endpoints for which `trapperkeeper-authorization`
is usedr:

* [`jruby-puppet.use-legacy-auth-conf`](#puppetserverconf) - Controls the
 method to be used for authorizing access to the HTTP endpoints served by the
 "master" service.  The applicable endpoints include those listed in the
 [Puppet V3 HTTP API](https://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/4.2/reference/http_api/http_api_index.html#puppet-v3-http-api).
 
 For a value of `true`, also the default value if not specified, authorization
 will be done in core Ruby puppet-agent code via the legacy
 [`auth.conf`](https://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/4.2/reference/config_file_auth.html)
 file.  For a value of `false`, authorization will be done through via
 `trapperkeeper-authorization`.

* `puppet-admin.authorization-required` and `puppet-admin.client-whitelist` -
 If either of these settings is present in the configuration, requests made to
 Puppet Server's administrative API will be performed per the values for these
 settings.  See the [`puppetserver.conf/puppet-admin`](#puppetserverconf) 
 section for more information on these settings.  If neither the
 `puppet-admin.authorization-required` nor the `puppet-admin.client-whitelist`
 setting is specified, requests to Puppet Server's administrative API will be
 done via `trapperkeeper-authorization`.

 * `certificate-authority.certificate-status.authorization-required` and
  `certificate-authority.certificate-status.client-whitelist` -
  If either of these settings is present in the configuration, requests made
  to Puppet Server's
  [Certificate Status](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/blob/master/api/docs/http_certificate_status.md)
  API will be performed per the values for these settings.  See the
  [`ca.conf`](#caconf) section for more information on these settings.  If
  neither the `certificate-authority.certificate-status.authorization-required`
  nor the `certificate-authority.certificate-status.client-whitelist` setting is
  specified, requests to Puppet Server's administrative API will be done via
  `trapperkeeper-authorization`.

Support for the use of the legacy `auth.conf` for the "master" endpoints and
for the client whitelists for the Puppet admin and certificate status endpoints
is deprecated.  You should consider configuring the above settings such that 
only `trapperkeeper-authorization` is used for authorizing requests.

### `master.conf`

This file contains settings for Puppet master features, such as node
identification and authorization.  The only setting that this file supports is
`allow-header-cert-info`.  That setting is now deprecated in favor of the
`authorization.allow-header-cert-info` setting in the `auth.conf` file that
`trapperkeeper-authorization` uses.  For more information on the `auth.conf`
file in general, see the [`auth.conf`](#authconf) section.  For more information
on the `authorization.allow-header-cert-info` setting, see the
[`Configuring the Authorization Service`](https://github.com/puppetlabs/trapperkeeper-authorization/blob/master/doc/authorization-config.md#allow-header-cert-info)
page.

In a default installation, this file doesn't exist.

* `allow-header-cert-info` determines whether Puppet Server should use authorization info from the `X-Client-Verify`, `X-Client-CN`, and `X-Client-Cert` HTTP headers. Defaults to `false`.

    This setting is used to enable [external SSL termination.](./external_ssl_termination.markdown) If enabled, Puppet Server will ignore any actual certificate presented to the Jetty webserver, and will rely completely on header data to authorize requests. This is very dangerous unless you've secured your network to prevent any untrusted access to Puppet Server.

    When the `master.allow-header-cert-info` setting is being used, you can
    change Puppet's `ssl_client_verify_header` setting to use another header
    name instead of `X-Client-Verify`; the `ssl_client_header` setting can
    rename `X-Client-CN`.  The `X-Client-Cert` header can't be renamed.  When 
    the `authorization.allow-header-cert-info` setting is being used, however,
    none of the `X-Client` headers can be renamed; identity must be specified
    through the `X-Client-Verify`, `X-Client-CN`, and `X-Client-Cert` headers.
    
    Note that the `master.allow-header-cert-info` setting only applies to HTTP
    endpoints served by the "master" service.  The applicable endpoints include
    those listed in the
    [Puppet V3 HTTP API](https://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/4.2/reference/http_api/http_api_index.html#puppet-v3-http-api).
    The `master.allow-header-cert-info` setting does not apply to the endpoints
    listed in the
    [CA V1 HTTP API](https://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/4.2/reference/http_api/http_api_index.html#ca-v1-http-api)
    or to any of the [Puppet Admin API](#puppetserverconf) endpoints.
    
    The `authorization.allow-header-cert-info` setting, however, applies to all
    HTTP endpoints that Puppet Server handles - including ones served by the
    "master" service and the CA and Puppet Admin APIs.
    
    If `trapperkeeper-authorization` is enabled for authorizing requests to the
    "master" HTTP endpoints - via the
    [`jruby-puppet.use-legacy-auth-conf`](#puppetserverconf) setting being set
    to `false` - the value of the `authorization.allow-header-cert-info`
    setting controls how the user's identity is derived for authorization
    purposes.  In this case, the value of the `master.allow-header-cert-info`
    setting would be ignored.

~~~
# Deprecated in favor of `authorization.allow-header-cert-info` in "auth.conf"
# master: {
#   allow-header-cert-info: false
# }
~~~

### `ca.conf`

This file contains settings for the Certificate Authority service.  The only
settings that this file supports are `authorization-required` and
`client-whitelist`.  These settings are now deprecated in favor of the
authorization settings in the `auth.conf` file that
`trapperkeeper-authorization` uses.  For more information, see the
[`auth.conf`](#authconf) section.  Since these settings are now deprecated,
the `ca.conf` file no longer appears in a Puppet Server package.

* `certificate-status` contains settings for the `certificate_status` and
 `certificate_statuses` HTTP endpoints.  These endpoints allow certs to be
 signed, revoked, and deleted via HTTP requests.  This provides full control
 over Puppet's security, and access should almost always be heavily restricted.
 Puppet Enterprise uses these endpoints to provide a cert signing interface in
 the PE console. For full documentation, see the
 [Certificate Status](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/blob/master/api/docs/http_certificate_status.md) page.

    * `authorization-required` determines whether a client certificate
     is required to access the certificate status(es) endpoints.  If set to
     `false`, all requests will be permitted to access this API.  If set to
     `true`, only the clients whose certnames are included in the
     `client-whitelist` setting are allowed access to the admin API.  If this
     setting is not specified but the `client-whitelist` setting is specified,
     the default value for this setting is `true`.

    * `client-whitelist` contains a list of client certnames that are whitelisted
     to access the certificate_status(es) endpoints.  Any requests made to this
     endpoint that do not present a valid client certificate mentioned in this
     list will be denied access.
     
   If neither the `authorization-required` nor the `client-whitelist` setting
   is specified, authorization to the certificate status(es) endpoints is
   controlled by `trapperkeeper-authorization`, through settings specified in
   the [`auth.conf`](#authconf) file.

~~~
# CA-related settings - deprecated in favor of "auth.conf"
# certificate-authority: {
#    certificate-status: {
#        authorization-required: true
#        client-whitelist: []
#    }
# }
~~~


## Logging

All of Puppet Server's logging is routed through the JVM [Logback](http://logback.qos.ch/) library. By default, it logs to `/var/log/puppetserver/puppetserver.log` (open source releases) or `/var/log/pe-puppetserver/puppetserver.log` (Puppet Enterprise). The default log level is 'INFO'. By default, Puppet Server sends nothing to syslog.

The default Logback configuration file is at `/etc/puppetserver/logback.xml` or `/etc/puppetlabs/puppetserver/logback.xml`. You can edit this file to change the logging behavior, and/or specify a different Logback config file in [`global.conf`](#globalconf). For more information on configuring Logback itself, see the [Logback Configuration Manual](http://logback.qos.ch/manual/configuration.html). Puppet Server picks up changes to logback.xml at runtime, so you don't need to restart the service for changes to take effect.

Puppet Server relies on `logrotate` to manage the log file, and installs a configuration file at `/etc/logrotate.d/puppetserver` or `/etc/logrotate.d/pe-puppetserver`.

### HTTP Traffic

Puppet Server logs HTTP traffic in a format similar to Apache, and to a separate
file than the main log file. By default, this is located at
`/var/log/puppetlabs/puppetserver/puppetserver-access.log` (open source releases) and
`/var/log/pe-puppetserver/puppetserver-access.log` (Puppet Enterprise).

By default, the following information is logged for each HTTP request:

* remote host
* remote log name
* remote user
* date of the logging event
* URL requested
* status code of the request
* response content length
* remote IP address
* local port
* elapsed time to serve the request, in milliseconds

The Logback configuration file is at
`/etc/puppetlabs/puppetserver/request-logging.xml`. You can edit this file to
change the logging behavior, and/or specify a different Logback configuration
file in [`webserver.conf`](#webserverconf) with the
[`access-log-config`](https://github.com/puppetlabs/trapperkeeper-webserver-jetty9/blob/master/doc/jetty-config.md#access-log-config)
setting. For more information on configuring the logged data, see the
[Logback Access Pattern Layout](http://logback.qos.ch/manual/layouts.html#AccessPatternLayout).

## Service Bootstrapping

Puppet Server is built on top of our open-source Clojure application framework,
[Trapperkeeper](https://github.com/puppetlabs/trapperkeeper). One of the features
that Trapperkeeper provides is the ability to enable or disable individual
services that an application provides. In Puppet Server, you can use this
feature to enable or disable the CA service, by modifying your `bootstrap.cfg` file
(usually located in `/etc/puppetserver/bootstrap.cfg`); in that file, you should
see some lines that look like this:

~~~
# To enable the CA service, leave the following line uncommented
puppetlabs.services.ca.certificate-authority-service/certificate-authority-service
# To disable the CA service, comment out the above line and uncomment the line below
#puppetlabs.services.ca.certificate-authority-disabled-service/certificate-authority-disabled-service
~~~

In most cases, you'll want the CA service enabled. However, if you're running
a multi-master environment or using an external CA, you might want to disable
the CA service on some nodes.


## Enabling the Insecure SSLv3 Protocol

Puppet Server usually cannot use SSLv3, because it is disabled by default at the
JRE layer. (As of javase 7u75 / 1.7.0_u75. See the
[7u75 Update Release Notes](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/7u75-relnotes-2389086.html)
for more information.)

You should almost always leave SSLv3 disabled, because it isn't secure anymore;
it's been broken since the
[POODLE vulnerability.](https://blogs.oracle.com/security/entry/information_about_ssl_poodle_vulnerability)
If you have clients that can't use newer protocols, you should try to upgrade
them instead of downgrading Puppet Server.

However, if you absolutely must, you can allow Puppet Server to negotiate with
SSLv3 clients.

To enable SSLv3 at the JRE layer, first create a properties file (e.g.
`/etc/sysconfig/puppetserver-properties/java.security`) with the following
content:

~~~
# Override properties in $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/java.security
# An empty value enables all algorithms including INSECURE SSLv3
# java should be started with
# -Djava.security.properties=/etc/sysconfig/puppetserver-properties/java.security
# for this file to take effect.
jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=
~~~

Once this property file exists, update `JAVA_ARGS`, typically defined in
`/etc/sysconfig/puppetserver`, and add the option
`-Djava.security.properties=/etc/sysconfig/puppetserver-properties/java.security`.  This
will configure the JVM to override the `jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms` property
defined in `$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/java.security`.  The `puppetserver`
service needs to be restarted for this setting to take effect.
